GERADOR DE MIGUÉ
===

In the words of Cleber de Oliveira:

> DESCUBRA

Link: [Gerador de migué](http://geradordemigue.herokuapp.com/)

This is an App to generate "Migués", a famous slang in brazilian portuguese that
means "excuse" in english.
This is a kind of excuse you use when you don't want to tell
people the truth for why you don't wanna do something or go to somewhere.
