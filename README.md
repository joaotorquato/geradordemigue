GERADOR DE MIGUÉ
===

In the words of Cleber de Oliveira:

> DESCUBRA

Link: [Gerador de migué](http://geradordemigue.herokuapp.com/)

This is an App to generate "Migués", a famous slang in brazilian portuguese that
means "excuse" in english.
This is a kind of excuse you use when you don't want to tell
people the truth for why you don't wanna do something or go to somewhere.

This project uses:
 -  The 2.2.4 Ruby version.
 -  Rails 4.2.5
 -  SQLite for development and Postgresql for production  

### Installing dependencies

You can install ruby with [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and then install the correct version of Ruby:

        $ rvm install ruby-2.2.4

You can install all necessaries dependencies using bundler like above:

        $ bundle install --without=production

In case you don't have bundler:

        $ gem bundler install

#### Automated tests with RSpec

You can run all tests using:

        $ rspec
